# ADD Iteration 2
## **Step 1: Reviewing Inputs**

Evlaution of inputs was already performed in the previous iteration. However, during second review, the team has decided to perform a reassessment of the priority of architectural drivers. Affected drivers include QA-7, CON-4, CON-6, CRN-5, and CRN-6.

## **Step 2: Drivers Selected for Consideration**

The goal of this iteration is to identify structures to support the primary functionality of the system. The following drivers have been selected for consideration to support the development of this greenfield system:



* **UC-1**: Students will have access to a list of available courses for them to register to. System maintainers will ensure that the students are eligible to register for their courses considering that course times and course prerequisites are met. Administrators will be allowed to manage courses for students.
* **UC-5**: Once connected to the system, administrators can manage courses. Actions that fall under course management include course creation, deletion, and updating. The system maintainer is also able to manage courses by setting certain course prerequisites. Administrators are able to appoint lecturers to courses.
* **CON-1**: Students would not have access to content in the enrolled course until the Professor allows access to the students.
* **CON-4**: Students can only enroll in course if they completed necessary prerequisites.
* **CON-6**: Students cannot enroll in a course that is not within their department.


## **Step 3: Elements for Refinement**

The modules found in the layers from the two architectures defined in the previous iteration of the CMS are the elements that will be selected for refinement in this iteration. This involves defining the method of collaboration of components within these modules.
