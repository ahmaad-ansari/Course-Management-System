## Business Case
This project aims to demonstrate how to design software architecture via a methodological set of processes, namely through using an Attribute Driven Design (ADD) approach. The product selected for design is a Course Management System (CMS). With the accelerating shift towards digitalization, the demand for an online environment to host course interactions has increased significantly over the past years. The CMS offers a range of online features, including but not limited to:

* The provision and storage of static content
* The provision and storage of dynamic content
* The integration of a messaging system to send and receive messages
* The representation of information based on user requirements and constraints

Three phases have been defined for the project. The first phase involves the processing of use cases, quality attributes, constraints, and concerns through requirements analysis. Second phase includes the first iteration of the ADD process for a principal use case. The final phase contains all three iterations of the ADD process along with a simple prototype implementation that demonstrates the principal use case.
